headline: About Us
lead: We are a hands-on venture capital fund, focused on AI and data companies.
intro: We are founded by founders, allowing us to bring our experience in running
  companies to our own ventures. We believe Artificial Intelligence will change every
  industry in the next decade; and more broadly that software will continue to impact
  every industry. We invest in founders with an exceptional drive and a unique perspective
  on their industry.

- heading: We believe in founders.
  text: VentureBuilders is run by people who have owned or built ventures. As a result,
    we have a distinct belief that founders and founding teams make winning companies.
    We look for people with an urge to win and a relentless drive to learn what it
    takes to make that happen. We seek people that reflect on their own performance
    and build teams to complement rather than compliment them.

  text: VentureBuilders enables top founder teams to grow their companies. We have
    a team of 25 specialists in marketing, UX, design, finance and HR to support ventures
    in areas where an in-house hire doesnâ€™t make sense. In addition, we have a broad
    network of experts to assist strategic decision making. Finally, our global executive
    program allows us to source top talent from top institutions such as INSEAD and
    Stanford (current partnerships).

- heading: We believe in AI & Data.
  text: Over the next decade, AI -by itself- will grow the global economy at a rate
    of 1.2% of global GDP per year. This means every industry vertical will be impacted.
    Drones equipped with computer vision will take over inspection and security jobs;
    Voice algorithms will allow call centers to fully automate parts of the conversation;
    and AI-driven machine learning will predict when your car needs servicing. We
    focus on practical applications of AI. In addition, we continue to invest in broader
    SaaS applications.
