We are AmberScript, a young startup based in Amsterdam. We are building SaaS software that enables users to automatically transcribe audio into text using AI speech recognition. Our own web text editor and human transcribers bring it to 100% accuracy. We help users to avoid the costs and pain of manually transcribing their interviews, meetings, or other audio.

Our self-developed AI speech to text engine obtains the best results in the market. Our product is being used by thousands of journalists, scientists, students, doctors and lawyers.

We are growing rapidly. We are looking for a marketing lead that can channel that growth and help us to target the right segments, promote our product and accelerate our customer acquisition and conversion. You will be the marketing lead, taking full ownership of the marketing and branding strategy and experience.

**Job Description**

* Create a unique brand experience and positioning from scratch

* Take full ownership of the marketing strategy

* Be an active member of the core leadership group and shape the company strategy, particularly the product & channeling strategy. Understand customer requirements and dependencies, prioritize what to build, sell and market

* Mentor and scale-up the marketing team (including recruitment, retention and team performance management)

**Preferably you fit the following profile:**

* You have studied marketing, business, economics or a quantitative field at university level

* You have 2\+ years of marketing experience, with an emphasis on online (SEO, SAO, SEM)

* You are passionate about growth hacking and data driven marketing

* You have a strong motivation to drive impact

* You are proactive, good in communicating in English and a fast learner

* You are able to work and live in Amsterdam (or willing to move)

We offer you the chance to work in a team of crazy-smart, passionate and driven people who work on cutting-edge technology. You will be in the core leadership team, directly working with the founding CEO of the company and leading a team of enthusiastic junior marketeers. We are flexible when it comes to working hours, we work and party hard and are passionate about what we do: change the world of transcription services. We are based in a great accelerator in Amsterdam.

At AmberScript, we are proud to always be thinking ‘better and bigger’. We are extremely product focused, knowing that success is ultimately dependent on the quality of the product. At the same time, we never lose track of the bigger picture. Go big or go home: we have grand ambitions and coming up with new features, services, products or strategic directions is part of our daily conversation.

Our goal is to make writing and typing redundant: pens are for drawing! Transcribing interviews and audio files is a first stronghold in the speech-to-text market, after which we aim to constantly improve our services. Our vision is to become the tool which makes writing abundant by automatically transforming all audio into summaries, to-do lists and notes.
