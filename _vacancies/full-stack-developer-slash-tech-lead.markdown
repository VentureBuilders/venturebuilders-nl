We are **AmberScript**, a young startup based in Amsterdam. We are building SaaS software that enables users to automatically transcribe audio into text using speech recognition, AI / algorithms and our own web text editor to bring it to 100% accuracy. We help users to avoid the costs and pain of manually transcribing their interviews, meetings, or other audio.

Our self-developed AI speech to text engine obtains the best results in the market, as proven by independent tests in the media. Our MVP is being used by 1500 journalists, scientists, students, doctors and lawyers.

In order to make text 100% right, we are currently optimizing our web-based text editor. Our challenge is to make it user-friendly, full of handy features and high performance. We are also looking at options to expand our product portfolio to other use cases of speech to text.

Currently, we are looking for a VP of engineering that can help us stabilize our product, scale it for growth and expand its features. Preferably you fit the following profile:

-	You have 2+ years of experience using React/HTML5/CSS3. Experience with Angular is a plus 
-	Preferably you have some Java back-end experience, not a must 
-	You have a strong motivation to drive impact by making product improvements 
-	You are proactive, good in communicating in English and a fast learner 
-	You are able to work in Amsterdam (or willing to move)

We offer you the chance to work in a team of passionate and driven people who work on cutting-edge technology. You will be the one leading the technical side of the team (not including the speech to text engine itself) and will effectively function as the technical co-founder. We are flexible when it comes to working hours, we work and party hard and are passionate about what we do: change the world of transcription services. We are based in a great accelerator in Amsterdam.

At AmberScript, we are proud to always be thinking 'better and bigger'. We are extremely product focused, knowing that success is ultimately dependent on the quality of the product. At the same time, we never lose track of the bigger picture. Go big or go home: we have grand ambitions and coming up with new features, services, products or strategic directions is part of our daily conversation.

Our goal is to make writing and typing redundant: pens are for drawing! Transcribing interviews and audio files is a first stronghold in the speech-to-text market, after which we aim to constantly improve our services. Our vision is to become the tool which makes writing abundant by automatically transforming all audio into summaries, to-do lists and notes.
