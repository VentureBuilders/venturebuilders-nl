Are you enthusiastic about e-commerce and want to contribute to the growth of a young and fast-growing internet company? Do you want to accomplish big things with a small team and help build our startup? Then we want you!

HelloSpecial is looking for ambitious E-commerce Buying Interns with the same drive as us. So, if you want to help create a successful business and learn some tricks of the trade along the way, then you have come to the right place!

**Your role will include:**

* Creating and managing suppliers and products for the website

* Sourcing new products to be featured on the site

* Strategizing and assisting with new supplier negotiations

* Being a point of contact for suppliers and customers

* Assisting with incoming inquiries via email, phone, and Zendesk

* Attending trade fairs with the Commercial Director

As a startup, the HelloSpecial team takes a real “all hands on deck” approach – meaning everyone helps out with a bit of everything (and that doesn’t mean getting the coffee). This really gives you the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of a company as a whole.

**We are looking for someone with:**

* A passion for e-commerce, positive attitude, good energy, and independence (basically, someone who can really vibe with the team!)

* Good knowledge of MS Word, Excel, Google Docs

* Excellent communication skills (both written and spoken)

* Fluent in English and Dutch

* We have recently expanded into the French market, so written and spoken French is a very big plus - but not necessary!

* Must be available for 5 days a week for a minimum period of 2.5 months

**The perks:**

* Endless opportunities to learn, develop yourself and contribute to company results

* Work in an incubation environment with 11 other startups

* Free lunch, fresh fruit, and snacks in the office every day!

* Friday drinks

* Regular team building activities

* A professional ping pong table
