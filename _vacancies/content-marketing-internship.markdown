**Are you enthusiastic about marketing and want to contribute to the growth of a young and fast-growing internet company? Do you want to accomplish big things with a small team and help build our startup? Then we want you!**

HelloSpecial is looking for ambitious Content Marketing Interns with the same drive as us. So, if you want to help create a successful business and learn some tricks of the trade along the way, then you have come to the right place!

**Your role will include:**
* Writing content for the website, blogs, and social media campaigns

* Researching new link partner-websites and connecting with them

* Strategizing and assisting with the creation of new Google Adwords and SEO campaigns

* Assist with strategizing and implementing social media campaigns

* Planning and curating email marketing content

* Customer service support through email, chat, and phone

As a startup, the HelloSpecial team takes a real “all hands on deck” approach – meaning everyone helps out with a bit of everything (and that doesn’t mean getting the coffee). This really gives you the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of a company as a whole.

**We are looking for someone with:**
* A passion for marketing, positive attitude, good energy, and independence (basically, someone who can really vibe with the team!)

* Good knowledge of MS Word, Excel, Google Docs

* Excellent communication skills (both written and spoken)

* Fluent in English

* Dutch is a plus but is not required

* We have recently expanded into the French market, so written and spoken French is a very big plus!

* Must be available for 5 days a week for a minimum period of 2.5 months

**The perks:**
* Endless opportunities to learn, develop yourself, and contribute to company results

* Work in an incubation environment with 11 other startups

* Free lunch, fresh fruit, and snacks in the office every day!

* Friday drinks

* Regular team building activities

* A professional ping pong table
