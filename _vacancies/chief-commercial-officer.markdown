We are **AmberScript**, a young startup based in Amsterdam. We are building SaaS software that enables users to automatically transcribe audio into text using speech recognition. AI / algorithms and our own web text editor bring it to 100% accuracy. We help users to avoid the costs and pain of manually transcribing their interviews, meetings, or other audio.

Our self-developed AI speech to text engine obtains the best results in the market, as proven by independent tests in the media. We have been appointed as top A.I. startup by StartupDelta and have won the Next Web exhibitor challenge. Our product is being used by thousands of journalists, scientists, students, doctors and lawyers with minimal marketing and no sales effort.

Now that we have achieved product-market fit, we are scaling rapidly. Currently, we are looking for a Sales lead / Chief Commercial Officer that can help us target the right segments, promote our product and accelerate our customer acquisition and conversion. Preferably you fit the following profile:

* You have studied (a subject related to) business, economics, marketing or quantitative analysis at college level (NL: WO) or have sales working experience

* You are passionate about sales, establishing partnerships and promoting tech products. Preferably you have driven sales in a world-class software company before

* You are not afraid to get your hands dirty and spend significant time driving your own sales

* You can lead and have a strong motivation to drive impact

* You are proactive, good in communicating in English (and preferably Dutch) and a fast learner

* You are able to work in Amsterdam

We offer you the chance to work in a team of passionate and driven people who work on cutting-edge technology. You will be in the core leadership team, directly working with (not for) the founding CEO of the company. As a startup, you will be the only sales person for some time and thus will drive your own sales from scratch as your primary job. We are flexible when it comes to working hours, we work and party hard and are passionate about what we do: change the world of transcription services. We are based in a great accelerator in Amsterdam.

**Your responsibilities will entail:**

* Setting up, selling and operating our B2B manual transcription service

* Introducing and selling AmberScript transcription software to new customers through warm and cold leads

* Forming partnerships with resellers, industry associations and inter organizational institutions

* Be part of the core leadership team being involved in strategic decisions

* Hire and lead a best-practice commercial department in due time

At AmberScript, we are proud to always be thinking ‘better and bigger’. We are extremely product focused, knowing that success is ultimately dependent on the quality of the product. At the same time, we never lose track of the bigger picture. Go big or go home: we have grand ambitions and coming up with new features, services, products or strategic directions is part of our daily conversation.

Our goal is to make writing and typing redundant: pens are for drawing! Transcribing interviews and audio files is a first stronghold in the speech-to-text market, after which we aim to constantly improve our services. Our vision is to become the tool which makes writing abundant by automatically transforming all audio into summaries, to-do lists and notes.
