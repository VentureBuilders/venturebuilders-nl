Intro: "People carry their smartphone around 24-7. In fact, for a lot people it's
  their most prized (and pricey!) possession. That's why we at Case24 believe that
  smartphone cases shouldn't be boring pieces of plastic, but instead can be a unique
  fashion accessory that reflects your personality. \nCase24 offers collections of
  designer prints but users can also upload pictures or use Facebook & Instagram photos
  to create a unique and personalised phone case. Each case is printed on demand in
  the Netherlands and shipped around the globe. \nAfter all, who said protecting your
  phone can't be done in style?"
