Story:
- heading: About Our Growth
  description: At AmberScript, we are proud to always be thinking 'better and bigger'.
    We are extremely product focused, knowing that success is ultimately dependent
    on the quality of the product. Our current customers (e.g. journalists, scientists,
    students, lawyers, doctors) use AmberScript to save time, costs and headache caused
    by manually transcribing audio. AmberScript is growing fast due to our strong
    uptake in the Netherlands and our recent push abroad.
- heading: In the future
  description: Our goal is to make writing redundant. Transcribing interviews and
    audio files is a first stronghold in the speech-to-text market, after which we
    aim to constantly improve our engine and expand our services. In the future, you
    will not need to take notes ever again!
quote: Technology takes away friction in society. With AmberScript, people avoid taking
  interview notes or spending hours transcribing and can focus on what is truly important
  to them
