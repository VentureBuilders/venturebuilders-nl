Intro: Recruitment in 2017 is terribly inefficient. Applyr is developing an AI-powered
  pre-selection, scheduling and analytics platform to screen candidates and schedule
  interviews automatically. Applyr chatbots allow employers to engage with and select
  the most qualified candidates, in a respectful, efficient way.

    Applyr was created to make recruitment more human. For recruiters and for candidates. Recruiters should get to spend their time and energy on high-value activities, like sourcing and interviewing candidates. And as a candidate, applying for a job should be an enjoyable experience, even when you’re not successful. With these objectives in mind, Applyr is designing recruiter chatbots who interact with candidates on a company's careers website. They use the power of AI to radically improve the hiring process.
    Many companies receive unmanageable volumes of applications. Yet they could benefit hugely from using Applyr chatbots and the new insights they generate. Applyr offers employers a super-easy solution that they can customise to reflect their employer brand.

  description: 'According to a survey by Oracle, 80% of businesses want chatbots by
    2020. We’ll do our best to meet the demand! Beyond English, Applyr is adding multi-lingual
    capabilities to the chatbots and recruiter dashboard — for the benefit of customers
    in North America and Europe especially. As the volume of chatbot conversations
    grows, Applyr will improve their NLP and machine learning capabilities. Using
    real-time feedback from recruiters and candidates, the chatbots will never cease
    to learn and improve.
