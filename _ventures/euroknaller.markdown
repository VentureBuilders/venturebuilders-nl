Story:
- heading: About Our Growth
  description: Euroknaller was co-founded by the founders of the successful daily
    deal company GroupDeal (sold in 2014 to TMG against EUR 15M valuation) and aims
    to increase retention by offering a loyalty scheme and gamification component.
    In addition, one of the main competitive advantages of Euroknaller are the sourcing
    capabilities of its buyer team and the ability to shorten the return on ad spend
    time in order to fuel growth.
- heading: In the future
  description: Euroknaller is currently active in the Benelux market and has the ambition
    to quickly expand to Germany, France and other EU markets (est. mid 2018). By
    generating more scale we expect to further improve our offering (product offers)
    and even further reduce prices for our subscribers.
